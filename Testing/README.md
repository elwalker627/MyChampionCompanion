# Overview of the Testing functionality

The testing class currently tests the Genetics project.
It is intended for this to test every project within the MyChampionCompanion
solution.

# Testing Principles

The tests in this project are primarily white box tests. These tests will also
be used for regression testing for when functionality is added.

The tests each test a very small concept in order to preserve them as unit
tests.

There were some tests that were written before a class was changed to internal
protection; rather than delete them, they were instead commented out.
